# GitHub Release Publication Instructions

## Repository Setup Required

Since no GitHub remote is currently configured, you'll need to:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com and create a new repository
2. Name it `fungimap` or `mycology-project` 
3. Choose **Public** for open source release
4. Do **NOT** initialize with README (we have our own)

### 2. Configure Remote and Push
```bash
cd "/Users/rohannorden/My Code/mycology-project"

# Add GitHub remote (replace with your actual repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/[REPOSITORY-NAME].git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# Or if main branch doesn't exist, try:
git push -u origin master
```

### 3. Create GitHub Release v0.1-demo

Once pushed to GitHub:

1. **Navigate to your repository** on GitHub.com
2. **Click "Releases"** in the right sidebar  
3. **Click "Create a new release"**
4. **Configure the release:**

   **Tag version:** `v0.1-demo`
   **Release title:** `FungiMap v0.1-demo - Demonstration Release`
   **Target:** `main` (or `master`)

5. **Release Description:**
```markdown
