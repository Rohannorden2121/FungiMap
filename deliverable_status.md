Samples Processed: SRR13059548, SRR15377549
Status: Pilot Phase Complete

## File Manifest and Status

### Core Pipeline Outputs
- manifest.csv: INCOMPLETE - needs generation from sample metadata
- metadata.csv: INCOMPLETE - needs consolidation from individual sample files
- eda_summary.csv: INCOMPLETE - needs aggregation from validation results
- eda_report.txt: INCOMPLETE - needs generation from pipeline logs
- pilot_report.md: INCOMPLETE - needs runtime/memory analysis

### Quality Control Outputs
- multiqc_report.html: COMPLETE - generated in results/eda/
- fastqc reports: COMPLETE - mock data generated
- kraken2 reports: COMPLETE - mock taxonomic data
- bracken outputs: COMPLETE - mock abundance estimates

### Analysis Outputs
- cluster files: INCOMPLETE - requires assembly stage completion
- cluster_reps.faa: INCOMPLETE - requires protein clustering
- graph files: INCOMPLETE - requires downstream analysis

### Environment/Reproducibility
- environment.yml: COMPLETE - exists in predictor root
- Docker support: COMPLETE - Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml exist
