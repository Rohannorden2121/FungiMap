MycoGraph-XL aims to establish a robust metagenomic analysis pipeline for investigating fungal diversity across diverse environmental samples. Our initial pilot study analyzed two European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) metagenome samples (accessions: SRR13059548, SRR15377549) spanning temperate forest and marine sediment biomes. The analysis pipeline integrates automated sample retrieval with rigorous quality control using FastQC, followed by taxonomic classification using Kraken2 with the comprehensive 8GB MiniKraken2 v2 database (04/2019 build), which includes bacterial, archaeal, viral, and fungal references.

Our preliminary analysis revealed significant quality variations across samples, with classification rates ranging from 0.05% to 97.97%. The high-quality sample (SRR13059548) showed clear bacterial dominance, with Salmonella enterica as the primary taxon (86.46%), while sample SRR15377549 was flagged for potential quality issues with only 0.05% classified reads and traces of human contamination. These findings underscore the importance of stringent quality control in metagenomic analyses and highlight the need for targeted fungal-specific databases.

Based on these initial results, our next steps include: (1) expanding the sample set with additional environmental metagenomes, (2) implementing enhanced contamination screening protocols, and (3) incorporating specialized fungal databases to improve taxonomic classification accuracy. We are also developing automated quality metrics and visualization tools to streamline the analysis pipeline for larger-scale studies.
