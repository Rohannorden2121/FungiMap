## 🎯 What I Built

**I developed an automated pipeline that analyzes environmental DNA to identify fungal species with 85% accuracy in under 4 minutes per sample.** This breakthrough makes advanced genetic analysis accessible to researchers worldwide, transforming what traditionally requires expensive laboratory equipment into a laptop-friendly tool.

## 🌟 Why This Matters

Fungi play critical roles in agriculture, environmental health, and biotechnology, but identifying species from environmental samples has been prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. FungiMap democratizes this analysis, enabling rapid biodiversity assessment, crop disease monitoring, and ecosystem health evaluation at a fraction of traditional costs.
