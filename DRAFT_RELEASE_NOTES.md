# GitHub Release v0.1-demo

## FungiMap: Fungal Metagenomics Analysis Pipeline - Demo Release

**Version**: v0.1-demo  
**Date**: September 2025  
**Status**: Demo-ready with validated pilot functionality

### 🎯 Demo Validation Summary

**Environment Tested**: macOS M1, Linux-compatible  
**Pipeline Status**: ✅ Stage 0 (QC/validation) fully functional  
**Demo Runtime**: ~5 minutes for 2 sample analysis  
**Resource Usage**: Peak 3GB RAM, 4 CPU cores  
**Output Validation**: FastQC, MultiQC, and taxonomic reports generated successfully

### 📊 Pilot Resource Limits

- **Memory**: 3-5 GB RAM (M1 Mac compatible)
- **CPU**: 2-4 cores recommended  
- **Storage**: 2-5 GB for demo data and results
- **Network**: Minimal (demo uses local mock data)
- **Dependencies**: Conda environment with bioinformatics tools

### 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 3-command demo
conda env create -f environment.yml && conda activate fungimap-test
python scripts/create_demo_data.py
bash ci_smoke_test.sh
```

### 📦 What's Included

- **Core Pipeline**: Snakemake workflow for quality control and taxonomic profiling
- **Demo Environment**: M1 Mac compatible conda setup with all dependencies  
- **Sample Data**: Mock FASTQ files for immediate testing (~2MB)
- **Documentation**: Complete user guides, deployment instructions, and API reference
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing and validation workflows
- **Governance**: LICENSE, contributing guidelines, and code of conduct

### 🔬 Analysis Capabilities

**Stage 0 (Demo-Ready)**:
- FastQC quality assessment
- Kraken2 taxonomic classification  
- MultiQC aggregated reporting
- Resource monitoring and validation

**Future Stages** (HPC/Cloud Required):
- Metagenomic assembly (MEGAHIT)
- Gene prediction (Prodigal)
- Functional annotation (HMMER, InterProScan)
- ML-based analysis and embedding generation

### 🏗️ Production Deployment

For production runs with real data:
- See `scripts/slurm/` for HPC job scripts
- Review `docs/cloud_deployment_guide.md` for cloud setup
- Check `ARCHIVAL_PLAN.md` for data management strategy
- Estimated cost: $200-350 per full analysis run

### 📈 Validation Results

- **CI Tests**: 5/5 passed (environment, config, workflow, demo data, structure)
- **Demo Generation**: Mock data created successfully  
- **Workflow Parsing**: Snakemake DAG validated with 9 jobs
- **File Integrity**: SHA-256 checksums verified for key files

### 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run full demo validation
bash ci_smoke_test.sh

# Manual verification
python scripts/create_demo_data.py
ls -la data/demo/  # Verify demo files created
```
