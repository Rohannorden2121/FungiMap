=== RESOURCE USAGE ===
Memory limit: 5GB (user approved)
CPU cores: 4 (user approved)
Peak memory: See resource_usage.csv for details
Execution time: ~2-3 minutes for demo data

=== OUTPUTS GENERATED ===
Quality Control Reports:
  ✅ results/demo/multiqc_report.html (main aggregated report)
  ✅ results/demo/fastqc/SRR13059548_demo_fastqc.html
  ✅ results/demo/fastqc/SRR15377549_demo_fastqc.html

Summary Data:
  ✅ results/demo/eda_summary.csv (sample statistics)
  ✅ results/demo/eda_report.txt (this report)
  ✅ results/demo/resource_usage.csv (system monitoring)

Demo Data:
  ✅ data/demo/SRR13059548_demo.fastq.gz (10k reads)
  ✅ data/demo/SRR15377549_demo.fastq.gz (10k reads)

=== PIPELINE VALIDATION ===
✅ Conda environment creation successful
✅ FastQC execution successful
✅ MultiQC aggregation successful
✅ Resource monitoring functional
✅ Output file generation working

=== LIMITATIONS (AS REQUESTED) ===
❌ Kraken2 database download skipped (would be ~8GB)
❌ Real SRA data download skipped (used mock data)
❌ Taxonomic classification not performed
❌ Assembly stages not executed
❌ ML/embedding analysis not performed

=== NEXT STEPS FOR PRODUCTION ===
1. Deploy to university HPC system
2. Download full MiniKraken2 database
3. Process real SRA data at scale
4. Enable assembly and annotation stages
5. Implement ML analysis pipeline

=== M1 MAC COMPATIBILITY ===
✅ Pipeline components work on Apple Silicon
✅ Memory usage stayed within approved limits
✅ Processing time acceptable for demo scale
✅ All required outputs generated successfully

This pilot validates that FungiMap can run on M1 Mac hardware
for demonstration and development purposes. Production workloads
should use HPC/cloud infrastructure as planned.
